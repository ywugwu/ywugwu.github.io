<!-- Incoming PhD Student at the George Washington University -->

I am an incoming PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.engineering.gwu.edu/) at [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/), where I will be supervised by [Prof. Robert Pless](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/).

Prior to this, I studied mathematics and computer science at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in Shenzhen, China.

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with a focus on multimodal learning and vision-language reasoning. I am particularly interested in developing models that can understand and reason about visual content in a way that is interpretable and explainable.

<!-- Aside from research, I read SciFi, adventure, and detective stories. Some of my favorites include [JoJoâ€™s Bizarre Adventure Part 7: Steel Ball Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Ball_Run), [The Three-Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)), [The Tokyo Zodiac Murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tokyo_Zodiac_Murders). I am also into competitive games and am fortunate to rank in the top 1% on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nightsh4de), [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/Night_Shade/), and [Dota 2](https://www.opendota.com/players/108382134).  -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
