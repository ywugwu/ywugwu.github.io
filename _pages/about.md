<!-- Incoming PhD Student at the George Washington University -->

I am a current MSCS student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.engineering.gwu.edu/) at [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Robert Pless](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/).

Prior to this, I studied mathematics and computer science at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in Shenzhen, China.

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with a focus on multimodal learning and vision-language reasoning. I am particularly interested in developing models that can understand and reason about visual content in a way that is interpretable and explainable.
