<!-- Incoming PhD Student at the George Washington University -->
Yu Wu (吴钰) is a Machine Learning Engineer at [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/).

He received his Master's degree in Computer Science from the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.engineering.gwu.edu/) at [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/), where he was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Robert Pless](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/).

Before that, he studied Mathematics and Computer Science at [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in Shenzhen, China.

His research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, particularly Multimodal Learning and Vision-Language Reasoning. He is interested in developing models that understand and reason about visual content in ways that are both interpretable and explainable.
